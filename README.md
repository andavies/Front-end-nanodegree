This program will teach you the skills required to become a Front-End Web Developer. We’ve designed this curriculum with expert web developers and hiring managers to ensure your portfolio displays the critical indicators of job-readiness. You’ll use HTML and the Bootstrap CSS framework to create your portfolio, and jQuery’s DOM manipulation to dynamically populate your resume. You’ll develop your own arcade game in JavaScript, build complex mapping applications using the Knockout framework, and use the Jasmine testing framework to develop and maintain applications.

### What is a nanodegree program?

A Nanodegree program is an innovative curriculum path that is outcome-based and career-oriented. Every program has a clear end-goal, and the ideal path to get you there. Courses are built with industry leaders like Google, AT&T, and Facebook, and are taught by leading subject matter experts. Students benefit from personalized mentoring and project-review throughout, and have regular access to instructors and course managers through moderated forums.

Graduates earn an industry-recognized credential and benefit from extensive career support. The ultimate goal of a Nanodegree program is to teach the skills you need, for the career you want, so you can build the life you deserve.

### Project 1: Build a Portfolio Site

You will replicate a design mockup in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

### Project 2: Interactive Resume

You will develop an interactive resume application that reads your resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template. You will use objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures to compose the content that will display on the resume.

### Project 3: Classic Arcade Game Clone

You will be provided with visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

### Project 4: Website Optimisation

You will optimize a provided website with a number of optimization- and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score and runs at 60 frames per second.

### Project 5: Neighbourhood Map

You will develop a single-page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this application, including: map markers to identify popular locations or places you’d like to visit, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. You will then research and implement third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations (such as StreetView images, Wikipedia articles, Yelp reviews, etc).

### Project 6: Feed-Reader Testing

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they’ve already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we’re now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That’s where you come in.
